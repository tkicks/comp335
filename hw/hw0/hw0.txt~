1. (* 1 2 3 (+ 4 5 6))
(* 1 2)
((* (* 1 2) 3))
((* (* 1 2 3) (+ 4 5))
((* (* 1 2) 3) (+ (+ 4 5) 6))

2. When rest is used, it takes the remaining elements of a list and turns them into a separate list than the first element.

3.a. (first(rest))
b. The second element is (4 5). It's the second list inside of the initial list not including the nested list inside the first list.

4. No there are not.  All s-expressions are ultimately binary, so each set of parentheses will have one arithmetic expression. Since s-expressions use recursion, it will perform equations in such a manner.
(* (+  (/ 9 3) 2) 1) will do (((9/3)+2)*1)
